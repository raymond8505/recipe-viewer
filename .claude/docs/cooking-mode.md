# Cooking Mode

## Cooking Mode is touch-first

Cooking mode is designed for use on a tablet or phone while actively cooking — often with wet or dirty hands.

- All interactive elements must have large tap targets (minimum 44×44px)
- Do not rely on hover states for anything functional (touch devices have no hover)
- Avoid small controls or precision-required interactions
- Prefer bold visual affordances: large buttons, visible drag handles, high-contrast feedback
- Cursor styles (`cursor-pointer`, `cursor-ns-resize`, etc.) are fine for desktop polish but are not the primary affordance signal

## Meal Mode

Cook mode supports grouping multiple recipes into a "meal" session. State lives in `CookingMode.tsx` as plain `useState` — no context or hook.

**Key invariants:**
- `mealRecipes[0]` is always the primary recipe and cannot be removed
- `activeSchema = activeIndex === 0 ? schema : mealRecipes[activeIndex].metadata.schema` — the `schema` variable is the primary recipe's schema, which can be overridden by the window API; `activeSchema` is what drives ingredients/instructions/notes rendering
- `useScaling` is called once on the primary recipe's `recipeYield`; non-primary recipes get `scale={1}` with no `onScaleChange` — scaling is intentionally primary-only for now
- All timers (primary + added recipes) land in a single localStorage bucket keyed by the primary recipe's URL hash. Timers from added recipes are seeded imperatively in `handleAddToMeal` and are **not** deduplicated — if a recipe is added a second time its timers are re-seeded

**Step completion** is tracked per-recipe via `completedStepsMap: Map<recipe.id, Set<string>>`. Step keys (`"i-j"` or `"i"`) are only unique within a recipe's own bucket.

**MealTabs pattern:** closable tabs use two adjacent `<button>` elements (tab name + ×) inside a flex `<div>` — NOT a button inside a button (invalid HTML). The × has `tabIndex={-1}` and is outside the roving tabindex cycle. All tab buttons share `aria-controls="meal-recipe-panel"` pointing to the single panel ID in CookingMode.

**MealSearch** is always rendered (no toggle). Click-outside clears query; ArrowDown from input moves focus to first result; ArrowUp from first result returns to input.

## Shopping List

Ingredients in both `CookingMode` and `RecipeDetail` are tappable checkboxes that build a shopping list, copied to clipboard as newline-separated text.

**State:**
- `CookingMode`: `Set<string>` keyed as `"${recipeId}::${ingredientText}"` — shared across all meal recipes in a session
- `RecipeDetail`: `Set<string>` keyed by bare ingredient text — separate, no cross-mode sharing

**Copy output is raw ingredient text, not scaled.** `getIngredientText(ing)` is used — the original schema string, ignoring current scale. Intentional: shopping is about what to buy, not cook-time quantities.

**Primary recipe copy reads from `schema` (live state), not `mealRecipes[0].metadata.schema`** — preserves window API overrides. Don't flatten this.
