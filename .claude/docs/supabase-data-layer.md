# Supabase Data Layer

## Select lists

**PostgREST select lists go through `selectColumns<Row>()`** (`src/lib/supabase.ts`) — never hand-write a comma-delimited column string. It compile-checks the list against the row type in both directions (unknown column rejected; missing column named in the error) and enforces write-only columns (`embedding`, `content`) by their absence from the Row type. Its return type is the joined string **literal** (template-literal `Join`) — this is load-bearing: supabase-js infers result row types by parsing the select string's literal type, and a plain `string` degrades results to `GenericStringError`, breaking single-cast `data as Row` sites.

## Repo layer, not raw table access

**Data access.** Route handlers must **not** call `getSupabaseClient().from("recipes")` directly — go through `src/lib/recipes.ts` (`getRecipeById`, `updateRecipeRow`, `archiveRecipe`, `createRecipeRow`) and map `RecipeRepoError` → 404 (`not_found`) / 500. `updateRecipeRow` **merges** the schema patch into `metadata.schema` (not replace) and syncs the top-level `name` column — relying on this is what keeps list/search columns from going stale. In tests, mock `@/lib/recipes` at the module boundary with `importOriginal` so `RecipeRepoError` stays real for `instanceof`. (OAuth routes still use raw `oauth_*` Supabase calls — there is no repo layer for those yet.)

**Derived `content` + `embedding` columns.** Both write helpers (`createRecipeRow`, `updateRecipeRow`) derive two columns from the `SchemaRecipe` so the MCP and UI paths produce them identically:
- **`content`** (NOT NULL) is the full markdown rendering of the recipe via `schemaToMarkdown` — recomputed on every create and on any schema-touching update. (This is also the exact text that gets embedded.)
- **`embedding`** (nullable `vector(768)`) is a best-effort Gemini embedding of that markdown via `generateEmbedding`. If generation returns `null` (e.g. Google is down) the write still succeeds — the column is omitted on insert and the prior vector is left untouched on update; it is never nulled.
- Embeddings are stored **raw (un-normalized)**: they're queried with pgvector cosine distance (`<=>`), which is scale-invariant, so normalizing would be a no-op and would also split the column's scale from the older n8n-written rows.
- Neither column is in `RECIPE_COLUMNS`, so both are **write-only** — not read back onto `RecipeRow`.

## Migrations

**Migration records in `db/migrations/` are applied out-of-band** via Supabase MCP `apply_migration` (project `xonkmdhnjpjkapnsmltu`); 0006+ show up in the project's migrations table, 0002–0005 predate that and don't — check `information_schema` for actual state, not the migrations list.
